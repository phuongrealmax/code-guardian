## Security Verification

1. **internal/ folder**: NOT tracked, properly ignored via .gitignore:48
2. **Paid backend code**: NOT exposed - only gateway abstraction included
3. **Secrets/API keys**: NOT hardcoded - all use environment variables
4. **License gateway**: STUB implementation only - actual verification on cloud API

---

## License Model

This release follows the **open-core model**:

- **Dev tier (free)**: Full MCP server with core modules
- **Team/Enterprise tiers**: Require license key verified via cloud API
- **Gateway abstraction**: `@ccg/cloud-client` provides offline-first caching

The actual billing and license management happens on `api.codeguardian.studio` (not included in this repo).
