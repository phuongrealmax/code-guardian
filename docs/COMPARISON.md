- Recall relevant information
- Learn from past errors
- Build project-specific knowledge

#### 4. Real-time Progress Dashboard

Visual workflow tracking:
- Mermaid diagram generation
- Blocker identification
- Live status updates
- WebSocket real-time sync

#### 5. Latent Chain Reasoning

Structured multi-phase reasoning:
- Analysis -> Plan -> Implementation -> Review

## Migration Guides

### From Guardrails AI

If you're currently using Guardrails AI validators:

1. Install CCG: `npm install -g codeguardian-studio`
2. Use `guard_validate` for similar validation
3. Gain additional benefits: memory, workflow, code metrics

### From Semgrep

CCG complements Semgrep rather than replacing it:

1. Keep Semgrep for deep security scanning
2. Add CCG for workflow, memory, and code metrics
3. Use both MCP servers together
